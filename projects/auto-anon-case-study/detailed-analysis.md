# Automotive — Campaign Evolution Case Study (2021→2025) (Detailed)

**Confidentiality:** No client name, no platform screenshots, no account IDs. Metrics are aggregated comparisons from internal client reports.

**Campaign Type:** Vehicle launch + sales campaigns (programmatic display, CTV, YouTube, paid search)

## ASK

### Problem Statement
Provide an anonymized, report-based comparison between recent campaigns (2024–2025) and earlier baselines (2021) to explain:
- How cost efficiency and engagement metrics evolved
- What strategic shifts were associated with changes in performance

### Hypotheses
- **H1:** Precision targeting can improve CTR and reduce wasted spend versus broad reach.
- **H2:** CTV can expand reach and maintain high completion rates while improving CPM efficiency.
- **H3:** Paid search quality improves when focusing on high-intent queries (often raising CPC but raising CTR).

## MEASURE

### Campaigns Analyzed
- **2021 baseline (Dec, 29 days):** Programmatic Display, YouTube Video, Paid Search
- **2024 launch (May, 14 days):** Programmatic Display, DV360 CTV, YouTube Video, Paid Search
- **2025 launch (Jun/Jul, 14 days):** Programmatic Display, DV360 CTV, YouTube Video, Paid Search
- **2025 sales (Jul, 21 days):** Programmatic Display

### Metrics
- **Display:** Clicks, Impressions, CTR, CPC, CPM, Cost
- **CTV:** Impressions, Complete Views, Completion Rate (CLR), CPM, CPC (reference), Cost
- **YouTube:** Impressions, Views, View Rate, CPV, CPM, 25/50/75/100% played
- **Search:** Clicks, Impressions, CTR, CPC, CPM, Cost

### Data Caveats
- Client identity anonymized.
- Durations differ across comparisons (14–29 days). Values are compared as reported.
- Vehicle types differ (gas vs hybrid vs EV). Interpretation accounts for market/audience size differences.
