## 📂 Proposals Overview

### 1. [Digital Marketing Measurement Framework](./digital-marketing-measurement-framework/)

**Client:** Automotive Dealer Network (Hyundai/Genesis Context)  
**Year:** 2020

**The Challenge:**  
Traditional metrics (clicks, impressions, CPM) couldn't measure true campaign ROI for $50K+ monthly ad spend.

**My Solution:**  
Designed a comprehensive "6 SHIFTS" framework that:

- Assigns monetary values to all micro-conversions
- Implements multi-touch attribution to credit the full customer journey
- Enables weekly dynamic budget reallocation based on ROAS

**Key Evidence:**

- In-Market Audience Targeting: **+285% conversions**
- 3rd-Party DMP Integration: **+120% conversions**

**Client:** Genesis (Hyundai Motor America) - G70 Launch  
**Year:** 2019  
**Focus:** Cultural Marketing, Community Engagement, Brand Repositioning

**The Challenge:**  
Genesis needed to break free from "Korean car" perceptions and establish itself as a premium lifestyle brand among affluent Korean-American consumers.

**My Solution:**  
Conceptualized GEN.TALK, a TED-style knowledge-sharing event series that positioned Genesis as a patron of intellectual community building.

**Strategic Approach:**

- Curated high-profile speakers (Min Jin Lee - Nobel nominee, Harvard professors, tech leaders)
- Created intimate networking events (120 attendees, quarterly)
- Integrated G70 as lifestyle enabler, not just product display

**Skills Demonstrated:** Cultural Strategy, High-Level Speaker Curation, Integrated Marketing, Community Leadership

## 🎯 Why Include Proposals?

**Strategic Thinking Over Execution:**  
While these projects weren't implemented, they showcase critical skills that are often invisible in executed campaigns:

1. **Problem Diagnosis** - Identifying root causes vs. symptoms
2. **Framework Design** - Structuring complex solutions systematically
3. **Stakeholder Communication** - Translating technical concepts into business value
4. **Industry Foresight** - Proposing strategies ahead of market trends

**Real-World Context:**  
Both proposals faced external barriers to execution:

- **Measurement Framework:** COVID-19 pandemic froze client marketing budgets (April 2020)
- **GEN.TALK:** Strategic direction or budget constraints

These are common scenarios in agency work, and the proposal quality demonstrates professional capability regardless of execution.
