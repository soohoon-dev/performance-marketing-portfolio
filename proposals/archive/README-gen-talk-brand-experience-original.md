# 🎤 GEN.TALK: Cultural Brand Activation Strategy

**Project Type:** Brand Experience Proposal (2019)
**Client:** Genesis (Hyundai Motor America) - G70 Launch Context
**Role:** Brand Strategy Lead & Program Director
**Target Audience:** Premium Korean-American Community in Los Angeles
**Concept:** TED-Style Knowledge Sharing Platform

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**"Marketing 3.0: From Function to Spirit"**

This project was a strategic proposal designed to position **Genesis G70** not just as a luxury vehicle, but as a **"Premium Lifestyle Brand"** within the influential Korean-American community in LA.

Instead of traditional product-centric advertising, I conceptualized **"GEN.TALK"**, a TED-style knowledge-sharing event series. The strategy focused on **Cause Marketing**—connecting the brand with the community's desire for intellectual growth, immigrant identity ("Paradigm Shift"), and networking.

---

## 📉 The Challenge & Insight

**The Problem:**

- Traditional marketing fails to build deep emotional connections with the high-net-worth immigrant demographic.
- The brand needed to move beyond "Korean Car" perceptions to "Premium Lifestyle Partner."

**The Cultural Insight:**

- The LA Korean community is transitioning from survival to **self-actualization**.
- There is a high demand for **"Intellectual Networking"** and mentorship among 30s-50s professionals, yet no branded platform existed to serve this need.

---

## 💡 Strategic Solution: "GEN.TALK"

I designed a branded content platform based on three core values: **Authenticity, Reliability, and Relationship**.

### 1. Program Concept: "The Knowledge Party"

- **Format:** A premium offline event series (3 times/year) combining lecture, networking, and dining.
- **Theme:** "Paradigm Shift" – Inspiring the immigrant community to change their perspective on life and success.
- **Venue:** CGV Genesis Hall (Cultural Hub).

### 2. Content Curation (The "Magnet")

To build credibility, I curated a lineup of speakers who represent the pinnacle of success and thought leadership in the Korean-American context:

- **Min Jin Lee:** Author of _Pachinko_ (Nobel Prize Nominee) – Topic: Identity & Literature.
- **Min Kim:** CEO of Open Bank – Topic: Business Growth & Giving Back.
- **Dennis Hong / Hong Rae Lee:** Robotics & Tech Leaders (Google).
- **Social Impact:** Leaders from KAGC (Civic engagement) and Filmmakers ("Jeronimo").

### 3. Brand Integration (The "Experience")

Instead of hard-selling, the G70 was integrated into the lifestyle experience:

- **G70 Ambassador Program:** Selecting influencers to drive the car and share lifestyle content.
- **Visual Experience:** "Photo with Genesis" zones and high-end dining catering.
- **Digital Connection:** Post-event networking via online community platforms.

**Promotion Strategy:**

- **Hyper-Targeting:** Focused on niche, high-influence communities (MissyUSA, Bay Area K Group, Amazon Seller Insider).
- **No Traditional Print:** 100% Digital & Community-driven marketing (Facebook, Instagram, Email).
