# Digital Marketing Measurement Framework

**Project Type**: Strategic planning exercise (2020)  
**Client Context**: Automotive dealer network (Hyundai/Genesis)  
**Focus**: Attribution modeling, ROI measurement, dynamic budget optimization

---

## 🎯 Challenge

Client needed to move beyond basic metrics (clicks, CPM) to answer: _"What is the actual ROI of our $50K+ monthly ad spend?"_

**Core Problems**:

- No unified measurement for conversion value
- Static budget allocation (couldn't respond to performance data)
- Last-click-only attribution (undervalued upper-funnel channels)

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution: "The 6 SHIFTS"

### 1. Action Valuation

Assign dollar values to all user actions (not just final conversions)

| User Action          | Assigned Value |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Form Submission      | $1,200         |
| Dealer Locator Click | $450           |
| Brochure Download    | $120           |
| Video View (100%)    | $115           |

### 2. Multi-Touch Attribution

Credit all touchpoints in the customer journey

**Key Insight**: Display advertising showed 5.6x higher assisted conversion value than last-click value, revealing its hidden contribution to conversions.

### 3. Dynamic Budget Optimization

Weekly performance-based reallocation

**Example**: Shift budget from 0.8x ROAS channels to 3.1x ROAS channels for +32% projected improvement

### 4. Audience Segmentation

1st + 3rd party data integration

**Evidence**: In-market audience targeting delivered +285% conversions vs. remarketing baseline

### 5. Search Intelligence

AI-driven paid search optimization achieved 51.27% conversion rate (vs. 20.73% average)

### 6. Dealer Support Program

Co-op program providing dealers enterprise-grade targeting at zero cost
